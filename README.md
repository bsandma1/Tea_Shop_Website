# Tea Shop Website

Codecademy's fourth full-stack engineer career path project!

Given a design spec, I created a clone of a Tea Shop website using HTML and CSS.  

The goal of the project was to experiment with some new concepts, such as a implementing a navbar and positioning elements with flexbox.

Files within the filesystem:

- HTML file - index.html
- CSS file - index.css 
- Design Spec - img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg
- Image files - 8 images used for the project
